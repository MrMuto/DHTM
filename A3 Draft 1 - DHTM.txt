The Suburb of Fitzroy 
Fitzroy, a Melbourne suburb rich in history and cultural diversity, has undergone significant transformations over the years. The land originally belonged to the Indigenous people, who were displaced as the area underwent urban development and gentrification.[1] The area's urban planning has been influenced by a series of legislative acts, shaping it into a blend of residential and industrial spaces. [2] By the 20th century, Fitzroy had gained a reputation as a 'slum territory,' leading to state-led slum clearance initiatives. 


Post-World War II, the suburb experienced a demographic shift with the arrival of European immigrants, adding a new layer of cultural and commercial vibrancy. Despite this, Fitzroy has not escaped the impacts of gentrification, affecting its socio-economic landscape and leading to the redevelopment of public housing for private interests. Today, Fitzroy stands as a complex blend of historical landmarks and modern establishments, reflecting the broader trends of colonialism, urban planning, and gentrification.


The Neighbourhood
The current demographic of Fitzroy does not represent previous inhabitants as urban development has attracted those of higher socio-economic status, attracted by the suburb's cultural richness and urban amenities. The neighbourhood displays a scarce representation of present day buildings to Indigenous people. In the 1950s, the implementation of 'slum clearance' policies, aimed at beautifying the area but effectively displaced those of lower socio-economic status.. and the establishment of the Atherton Gardens Public Housing Estate in the mid-1940s. [3] However, the wheel of gentrification has come full circle, with the Atherton Public housing site now being redeveloped for private interests.[4]


53 George Street: The Residence Assigned


53 George Street is a building of significance as its architecture and aesthetic features modified reflect the area's past and changing needs of its residents. The building's location offers easy access to local amenities, making it a convenient choice for tenants.


53 George Street stands as a historical monument in Fitzroy, possibly designed by John Gill in 1853, although this attribution remains unverified. The terrace was constructed prior to 1858 and was initially owned by William Reynolds, a gentleman who primarily rented out the properties. The building has served various purposes over the years, including functioning as a boarding house, which adds layers to its historical significance.


Architecturally, the building is a blend of classical elements, featuring an unusual classicizing design. The central pair of the terrace is particularly noteworthy, with paved pilasters projecting through the string course and cornice, terminating in a debased pediment. This unique composition sets it apart and could make it the earliest surviving example of a terrace development outside Melbourne that conforms to the 1849 Melbourne Building Act's requirements.


The building's internal layout will be divided to accommodate students in our group. Given its historical background and architectural significance. However, it's crucial to note that while the building's age and unique design offer a distinct charm, they also present challenges for modern adaptations, such as accessibility features for disabled individuals.


The Victorian Heritage Council recommends further research to establish the terrace's true importance, a sentiment that resonates with our experience of the building. Its historical and architectural layers make it a compelling subject for deeper study, even as it continues to serve as a residential space.


Student Accommodation
Living in 53 George street provides opportunities to engage with history, architecture and community. Though, sharing this space comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages, which are outlined below.

Advantages:


* Proximity to Indigenous heritage landmarks and other notable spaces enriches the cultural experience of living here.
* The layout of the interior spaces is conducive to communal living, fostering a sense of community among the residents.
* The neighbourhood amenities are within walking distance, making it convenient for daily activities.


Disadvantages:


* The building's age poses challenges for modern adaptations, such as installing accessibility features for disabled individuals.
* The layout, while charming, may not offer the level of privacy some may desire in a shared living arrangement.


The house has several design interventions to adapt to modern living requirements while preserving its historical character.


Ground Floor Modifications:
The front gate and door have been widened, offering better accessibility. The partition walls between the Lounge and Bedroom 4 have been removed, creating a more expansive living area with sliding door access. The laundry area has been repurposed to extend the dining and kitchen space. An alfresco structure has been added to the narrow outside space, providing protection against the elements and a storage area for bicycles. The garage has been renovated and converted into a multi-purpose space that could serve as a venue for events or even small businesses.


Upstairs Changes:
The northern walls of Bedrooms 1 and 2 have been adjusted to create more bathroom space. This alteration allows for a better bathroom layout, including the possibility of rotating the bathtub to free up space for Bedroom 3. Additional windows and skylights have been installed where possible to allow more natural light into the rooms.


Advantages:
The modifications enhance the house's functionality and adaptability. The ground floor changes, especially the garage conversion, offer the potential for multi-use, including small business operations. The house's proximity to public transport options adds to its appeal.


Disadvantages:
While the house offers various advantages, it also presents challenges. The car would have to be relocated when the garage is used for events or business activities. Although public transport is readily available, this could be an inconvenience for some.


Conclusion on Repurposing:
The house's layout and recent modifications make it a strong candidate for student accommodation. Its adaptability and multi-use spaces offer opportunities for small business operations, aligning well with the area's rich cultural and community fabric. However, considerations around car storage and public transport options would need to be addressed.




The building's potential for adaptive reuse is considerable, especially given its historical significance. Its layout and internal spaces could be modified to better suit the needs of a student population, such as creating study nooks or communal areas for social interaction. Furthermore, the building's location and historical significance make it an ideal candidate for a migrant small business, adding another layer to its adaptability.


During the quarantine, the building's layout proved both an advantage and a challenge. The communal spaces allowed for shared experiences, but also required adjustments to maintain social distancing protocols. Overall, the building has the potential to be repurposed for student accommodation, but this would require thoughtful planning and investment to address its limitations.


Social Networks: Redeveloping for an Immigrant Business
The potential for 53 George Street to serve as a hub for a small immigrant business adds another layer to its adaptability and community engagement. The garage, already renovated for multi-purpose use, is the ideal space for this venture.


Type and Requirements of the Business:
The garage could be repurposed as a beauty salon, requiring utilities like plumbing and electricity. The space must be organized to accommodate equipment, client servicing, and a waiting area. Emergency protocols must also be in place.


Modifications for Business Accommodation:
To counterbalance the loss of residential area due to the business, other spaces within the house and outdoors could be utilized more effectively. The garage would need to be weather-proofed and equipped with heaters, possibly requiring additional plumbing.


Accessibility and Signage:
Adequate disability access would be provided through the back of the property. The existing WC would be maintained, and appropriate signage in multiple languages would be installed to guide clients and visitors.
Entry and Utilities:
The back lane, Lt Victoria St, with its Victorian cobblestone, leads to the garage, providing a distinct entry point for the business. Staff could use the front door of the house for entry, separating residential and business pathways. Key utilities like heating/cooling, electricity, water, and lighting would be adequately provided in the garage.


By integrating a small immigrant business into its structure, 53 George Street not only diversifies its utility but also enriches its social and cultural contributions to the Fitzroy community. This aligns well with the area's history as a hub of various communities and adds a new dimension to its contemporary identity.


Health and Quarantine
Our relationship with domestic spaces is affected by quarantine, blurring the lines between work, leisure, and rest. The lockdown measures necessitate a reevaluation of daily routines and the use of space within 53 George Street.


Impact on Daily Routines:
Access to parks for exercise and mental well-being becomes crucial during lockdowns. Fortunately, several parks like Fitzroy Gardens, Carlton Gardens, and Atherton Reserve are within a 1km radius, making them accessible for daily walks or exercise.


Breakdown of Domestic Boundaries:
The pandemic has diffused the once-sacred boundaries within the home. Spaces now serve multiple functions—work, play, rest, and leisure often occur in the same area. This necessitates a thoughtful approach to interior design to maintain a semblance of separation.


Accessibility to Amenities:
Most amenities, such as grocery stores and pharmacies, remain within reach. However, the operation of the small business in the garage would be subject to government regulations and may need to pause operations temporarily.


Adjustments and Recommendations:
The backyard space can be utilised more effectively, perhaps as an extended living area or for small-scale gardening, to enhance mental well-being. Interior spaces should be designed to ensure adequate ventilation and natural lighting, incorporating elements of biophilic design where possible.


Privacy and Quarantine:
Each member of the household must have adequate space for both interaction and solitude. In case of a COVID-19 outbreak, the design allows for each member to quarantine in their individual rooms, minimising the risk of spread.


By proactively adapting to the challenges posed by the pandemic, 53 George Street can serve as a model for how residential spaces can be flexible, safe, and supportive in health emergencies. 






Adaptive Reuse: A Case for Flexibility and Sustainability
53 George Street's architectural significance and recent design interventions make it a prime candidate for adaptive reuse. The residence's layout and modifications, such as the widened front door and repurposed garage, offer both functional and aesthetic advantages. These changes not only enhance the living experience for students but also provide the flexibility to accommodate a small immigrant business, specifically a beauty salon. Essential utilities like plumbing and electricity are already in place, and the garage can be weather-proofed to create a comfortable, accessible space.


The house's adaptability extends to pandemic preparedness. Design features allow for both communal living and necessary isolation, meeting changing public health guidelines. For instance, the backyard can be utilized for outdoor activities during lockdowns, and each room is designed to serve as a quarantine space if needed.


In summary, 53 George Street exemplifies how adaptive reuse can meet diverse needs while preserving historical and architectural value. It offers a sustainable living model that aligns with broader community goals of inclusivity and economic viability, making it well-suited for repurposing as both student accommodation and a small business venue.


Conclusion
The residence at 53 George Street in Fitzroy presents a compelling case for adaptive reuse, serving as both student accommodation and a small business venue. Its rich historical background, architectural significance, and recent design interventions align with the diverse needs of its potential occupants. The house's layout and modifications offer flexibility, from accommodating a small immigrant business to ensuring pandemic preparedness.


The property's proximity to parks and public transport options adds to its appeal, while its adaptability ensures that it can meet changing public health guidelines. The residence also aligns with broader community goals, including inclusivity and economic viability, making it a sustainable choice for repurposing.


In light of these factors, 53 George Street holds significant potential for adaptive reuse. Its versatility and thoughtful design make it an ideal candidate for meeting the evolving needs of students and small business owners alike, particularly within the context of a post-pandemic world.
