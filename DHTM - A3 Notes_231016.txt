3. 194 Moor Street, Fitzroy
4. 276 Napier Street, Fitzroy  
5. 283 Fitzroy Street, Fitzroy
In week 8 students will select their share house allocations and they will be grouped according to house choices. Each group will include a mix of Australian and International students, and a gender mix. Students will be provided a brochure of their house and a collaged map of Fitzroy showing the context of all four houses.
Students will build a narrative around the potential changes and redevelopment options for their houses for student accommodation, following a series of steps covered between weeks 9-12. The final submission is an essay which documents all the changes to their house through these steps. These steps are outlined below. Students have the option of using the topics of each step as a subheading in their essay if it provides more clarity.

1. Introduction
From the 1920s, the inner city suburb of Fitzroy became known as the urban heart of Aboriginal Victoria. It was the birthplace of many important Aboriginal organisations, centre stage for the fight for civil rights and a meeting place for linking-in with family and community (including members of the Stolen Generations).


The Aboriginal History of Fitzroy walking trail identifies sixteen sites of significance (from the 1920s onwards) in the area. Each site is marked with a bronze plaque. Further details of this history can be found on Yarra City Council's website (see link above).


2. Dispossession and Dispersal of the Wurundjeri (Woiwurrung) People
The Wurundjeri (Woiwurrung) people before contact lived,
worked and looked after the land in the area now known as
Fitzroy since the beginning of time. The cities of Fitzroy and
Collingwood now stand on these traditional lands.
The settlement and development of the city of Melbourne
impacted heavily upon the Wurundjeri people. Dispossession
of land, dislocation, frontier clashes, massacres and the impact
of introduced diseases saw a dramatic decline in Aboriginal
populations of the area. In 1835, Wurundjeri ‘Ngurungaetas’
(or tribal leaders) Billibellary and Bebejan were tricked
into signing a treaty (later deemed invalid by the English
government) with visiting businessman, John Batman, that
signed over a large portion of Wurundjeri land in exchange for
gifts such as flour, blankets and steel axes.


As the government tried to assimilate Aboriginal people into
white society, the Wurundjeri people were encouraged to
move to the Merri Creek Protectorate Station. When this
failed, people were moved to the Acheron Mission Station,
and later to Coranderrk (run by the Aboriginal Protectorate
Board), near Healesville (see map below). Coranderrk was
closed in the 1920s by the government, but some of the
Wurundjeri refused to leave and stayed on.


3. Fitzroy Aboriginal Community
Despite the effects of colonisation, Aboriginal people and
culture survived and the strong bonds between families and
clans could not be broken. From the 1920s onwards, the
Aboriginal community of Melbourne began to steadily increase
with the wave of Aboriginal people coming straight from the
missions such as Thomas James, Grace Brux, Margaret Tucker,
Martha Nevin (Wandin, Wurundjeri women) and William
Cooper, who moved to Fitzroy from Cummeragunja between
1920 and 1935.


By the 1950s, Fitzroy supported a community of more than
300 Aboriginal people, with many living in surrounding inner
city suburbs. Fitzroy not only became the largest Aboriginal
community in Victoria, it also became the social and political
hub of Aboriginal Melbourne.

HOUSING, PLOTS AND NEIGHBOURHOOD AMENITIES
In week 10, students will divide into their groups and map how they will use the space within the share-house and the spaces in the surrounding neighbourhood.


IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
   * Look at Kevin Lynch’s iconic hand-drawn 1959 map as devices for mapping the elements in the city. MIT Libraries, Dome, Lynch, Kevin. 1959. MC 208, Box 6, Field Analysis Whole City. https://dome.mit.edu/handle/1721.3/36507
   * Draw the share-house in the context of the neighbourhood. Consider key amenities such as communal shared zones, parks, transport stops, public school, shops, post office, public pools, and other emotional and phenomenal qualities that are harder to map, such as fear and safety.
   * Identify important landmarks including Indigenous examples from the App and Map.

Fear & Safety
Resource: https://yourgroundarchive.org/
   * general feeling of uneasiness
No major issues for access to amenities in nearby retail and commercial districts (2-5 minute walk). Though there are reports of a ‘general feeling of being unsafe’:
Reports of:
   * Sexual misconduct and harassment at bars on the street and public transport (86 tram), street crimes involving substances and violence.
   * Homeless and those with substance abuse issues having a presence.


Avoid:
   * Lennox St, Nicholson and Victoria St - drug related issues.
Hotspot between North Richmond and South Abbotsford. Avoid the southeast as best you can, especially at night.
Smith Street
 I was roofied at a bar here, and have been groped in clubs/bars and harrassed on the street multiple times.
20-24 years old, Female, LGBTIQ+
Gertrude Street, Victoria
 I was harassed on the 86 tram. There were a few males watching, but nobody helped me.
30-34 years old, Female
Little Napier Street, Victoria
 poor lighting - feels unsafe
35-39 years old, Female
Cycling heaven
 I walk and ride up Napier st at all hours and usually feel safe. There are often people around, front doors open and eyes on the street. Places like the dog park and youth centre make feel like a safe and happy environment.
________________
   * Draw the paths and your route through the neighbourhood to various amenities that you would need during the week. Consider the paths you travel the most?
   * Zoom out to the scale of Melbourne. How will you get to the university?


INSIDE THE HOUSE
Draw the outline of your share-house (you can just use your notebook and pen or digital device).
Identify key architectural and spatial qualities of your share house: (age, style, key features, typology etc.):


From 53-59 - George St - HeritageVic_583.pdf
NAME: Terrace
ADDRESS: 53-59 George Street
CONSTRUCTION DATE: Pre 1858
ALTERATNS./ADDITNS:  Facades of 53 and 59 stripped of surface
modelling.
ARCHITECT: John Gill?
BUILDER: Unknown
FIRST OWNER: 1858 William Reynolds/gentleman.
FIRST OCC./USE: Various/residences
PRESENT OWNER: Various
PRESENT OCC./USE: Various/residences
CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS: Rendered masonry
INTACTNESS/CONDITION: Nos. 55, 57 substantially intact; nos. 53,59 - facade altered.
AREA STREETSCAPE: Part of recommended area A4


Importance:
This terrace was constructed prior to 1858, and was possibly designed by John Gill in 1853, although this has not been verified. 


The facades have been altered to numbers 53 and 59, but the unusual classicizing design of the central pair with paved pilasters projecting through the string course and cornice (and terminating in a debased pediment) is of considerable interest.


If these houses can be attributed to Gill, they are of considerable importance. They would provide the earliest surviving example of a terrace development outside Melbourne conforming to the requirements of the 1849 Melbourne Building Act.


   * Age = The terrace was constructed prior to 1859. (from 53-59 - George St - HeritageVic_583.pdf)
   * Style: 
   * Classisical(?)
   * Key features:
   * Unusual  classicizing design of the central pair with paved pilasters projecting through the string course and cornice (and terminating in a debased pediment) is of considerable interest.
   * Classicizing design of the central pair with pilasters projecting through the string course and cornice results in an unusual composition. 
   * Typology: 
   * Residential buildings: Buildings that are used for dwelling purposes, such as houses, apartments, and condominiums.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
It is recommended that this terrace be brought to the attention of the Historic
Buildings Council and that further research be undertaken to establish the true
importance of the terrace.


Discuss how you will occupy it among the group. Divide the internal spaces to accommodate students in your group.


BUILDING ANALYSIS AND EVIDENCE;
These four houses were constructed prior to 1858. William Reynolds, a gentleman,
owned them at this date. Reynolds occupied all the properties at various
times, but primarily they were rented out. Numbers 55 and 59 were used as
boarding houses for long period of time.2
It was not possible to trace these houses in the Melbourne City Council Rate Books,3
but it is possible that the two houses designed by John Gill in George Street,
Collingwood in 1853 formed part of this group. The unusual classicizing design
of the central pair with pilasters projecting through the string course and
cornice results in an unusual composition. A similar classicizing
element can be seen behind the verandahs on the facade of 163-165 Victoria
Parade, but the detailing is less notable.


Study accessibility and appropriateness for re-zoning as student housing.
Consider the following prompts:


Where is your bedroom?
   * My bedroom (Bedroom 3) would be upstairs as I enjoy the quiet, and being in the main passageway would not be ideal for my routine and lifestyle. I only have to deal with the shower noise.
53, George Street Design Interventions:
Ground Floor:
   * Front gate widened
   * Front door widened and larger door installed
   * Lounge and Bedroom 4 partition walls removed to enlarge the space:
   * Sliding door access to Lounge
   * Laundry removed to make more dining and kitchen space
   * Outside space (narrow bit) has an patio or alfresco structure installed to protect against elements:
   * Bicycle can be stored here
   * Outside WC modified to become laundry?
   * Garage renovated to more solid materials - converted to a living space to accommodate events and activities:
   * Small businesses could run out of this.
   * Car would have to be relocated when hosting events / running the business
   * Depends on car usage but there are a lot of public transport options.
   * Could house the car and accommodate human activities?
Upstairs:
   * Northern wall of Bedroom 1 has been brought in / length of the room reduced
   * Northern wall of wall of Bedroom 2 has been brought out to accommodate more Upstairs Bathroom space:
   * Bathroom: The extra space could mean the bathtub gets rotated in parallel to the window, freeing up more space for Bedroom 3
   * Bedroom 3: Install window in west wall
   * Bedroom 2: Install skylight or window if the neighbours house isn't too close
Discuss access and accessibility:
Do you need to modify the interior?
Interior Modifications:
   * Another window on the north wall would allow more sun in during winter months.
   * Front door widened and larger door installed
   * Northern wall of wall of Bedroom 2 has been brought out to accommodate more Upstairs Bathroom space.
   * Lounge and Bedroom 4 partition walls removed to enlarge the space:
   * Sliding door access to Lounge
   * Laundry removed to make more dining and kitchen space
   * Outside space (narrow bit) has an patio or alfresco structure installed to protect against elements:
   * Bicycle can be stored here
   * Garage renovated to more solid materials - converted to a living space to accommodate events and activities:
   * Small businesses could run out of this.
   * Car would have to be relocated when hosting events / running the business
   * Depends on car usage but there are a lot of public transport options.
   * Could house the car and accommodate human activities?
   * Northern wall of Bedroom 1 has been brought in / length of the room reduced
   * Northern wall of wall of Bedroom 2 has been brought out to accommodate more Upstairs Bathroom space:
   * Bathroom: The extra space could mean the bathtub gets rotated in parallel to the window, freeing up more space for Bedroom 3
   * Bedroom 3: Install window in west wall
   * Bedroom 2: Install skylight or window if the neighbours house isn't too close






Revise the plan of your house to represent its refurbishment.
Note its redevelopment to meet the disability code. 
   * Refer to the NDIS Design Standards for accessibility. Look at Kevin Lynch’s maps and identify disability standards and access for people with disabilities.

SOCIAL NETWORKS


SOCIAL NETWORKS: ADAPTATION TO MIGRANT COMMUNITIES
In week 11, groups will conduct research on the Fitzroy suburb and adapt the house for renting to a small immigrant business that serves the African-Australian diasporic community in the Atherton Gardens Estate.


RESEARCH
   * Refer to historical maps of Fitzroy (see general sources) to understand the development of the suburb. Identify sites of significance to your share the house.
   * Look at the following sources:
   * Fitzroy History Society’s Atherton Walk: https://fitzroyhistorysociety.org.au/atherton-walk/
   * ACMI: Fiona Hillary, Atherton Street Memorial to Melbourne Slums: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEnc8oQpEKw
   * Black Diaspora Naarm: https://www.cultureascreative.com/black-diasporas-naarm-melbourne
   * Consider the transformation of Fitzroy through so called ‘slum clearance’ and urban renewal.
   * [refer to Reading Response - W11]: 
DHTM - RR09 (W11) - Final
WIP_DHTM - RR09 (W11) - Scratch
   * Analyse the transformation of Fitzroy through gentrification and address the social polarisation reflected in physical land use and property boundaries.
   * Discuss humanitarian migrants and the experience of the African Diaspora at Atherton Gardens Estate. How can we reconcile the different social perceptions of these two types of housing high-and low rise?
   * Resources: Readings notes and also - vic-housing-statement-explainer
REDEVELOPING FOR AN IMMIGRANT BUSINESS
Consider:
   * How you will rent the room to the small immigrant business
   * The type and requirements of the business:
   * Hair services(?)
Describe How the house will be modified to accommodate the business:
   * Reallocating spaces of the house to accommodate the loss of residential area:
   * Consider:
   * How other outdoor spaces can be utilised
   * Weather proof the garage
   * Adequate disability access through the back
   * Might have to maintain the WC outside
   * Signage
   * Main access points to business and parking facilities
   * The back lane = Lt Victoria St - leads to the back lane of Victorian cobblestone.
   * Separate pathways, entry/exit points or spaces for staff/employees
   * Staff can come through the front door
   * Key utilities required for the business such as heating/cooling, electricity, water, lighting and furniture
   * Heaters in the garage - might need plumbing in there too
Health & Quarantine
In week 12, groups will adapt their home according to Covid quarantine restrictions.
   * Study the prepared map of Fitzroy showing your share house.
   * Assume students are quarantined for four weeks and can only move within a 1 km radius of your house. The radius is indicated in light blue circles for each house on the map.
   * Discuss the different ways in which quarantine affects spaces:
Anoma’s position piece analysis of the temporal and spatial of buildings repurposed for quarantine - framing from Michel Foucoult’s essay ‘Of Other Spaces: Utopias and Heterotopias’, specifically Foucoult’s concept of heterotopias -  ordinary / innocuous spaces programmatically transformed innocuous buildings violently and temporarily transformed - alienated as viral incubators and programmatically transformed to comply with government enforced biosecurity measures. Made socio-economic stratifications visible:
   * Revealed the effects of government mismanagement of police enforced lockdown on vulnerable communities - low-socioeconomic status - culturally diverse migrant communities and elderly - for biosecurity reasons:


Anoma examines normative positions - breakdown of preconceived notions attributing to norms around physical and phenomenological boundaries (temporal and spatial) between public and private space. 


   * Consider how lockdown will impact your daily and weekly routines, like studying, shopping or exercise?
   * Access to parks essential [take a look at screenshots]
   * How has the pandemic affected home space?
   * Explain the breakdown between domestic boundaries once sacred (Foucault)
   * Separation between leisure, work, play and rest.
   * Spatio-temporal (Anoma)
   * What amenities can or can’t be reached?
   * What activities are no longer possible?
   * Small business
   * What adjustments are needed?
   * Utilise the backyard space.

ADAPTIVE REUSE OF A FITZROY TERRACE DWELLING FOR STUDENT HOUSING: ESSAY [25%]
The final individual submission will be in the form of an essay consisting of 1000 words. The Council has selected your shared house for demolition. The university wants to buy it for student accommodation. The essay needs to evaluate the building’s potential for adaptive reuse by describing your sharehouse experience. Your essay and those of others will be added to a report on the feasibility [or not] of retaining the house.

You must not identify your share house fellow tenants by name. They need to be identified as tenant A, Tenant B, Tenant C etc.


Essay Title:
Adaptive Reuse of a Fitzroy Terrace Dwelling for Student Housing
House Address: 53 George Street, Fitzroy
Your name and number.




Tenants: [For example]
Tenant A: A first year architecture student from Malaysia who practises violin
   * Sound dampening 
Tenant B: An Australian student from the Gold Coast who plays soccer and owns a bicycle
   * Need storage space for bicycle
   * Access in and out - depends on the access pathways
Tenant C: A second year landscape architecture student from Melbourne
   * Studio space


Description of the House: When describing the house make sure to articulate its historical significance and key architectural and aesthetic characteristics or features. Tell us how it is placed on the site, its orientation, accessibility and internal layout. Use footnote references to the subject readings and others you might find. This section needs to be descriptive and interpretive.


Sharing the House: The essay must describe your experience of sharing the house, noting the advantages and disadvantages and covering the previous four steps. This section needs to be both critical and interpretive. It must reach a conclusion on whether this house has the potential to be repurposed for student accommodation based on your shared experience. You can visit each step in the order that you studied it in class. Among the key issues you need to address are the proximity to Indigenous heritage landmarks and other notable spaces, the layout and adaptability of the interior spaces including for disability, the available neighbourhood amenities, the potential to rent a space for a migrant small business and how you adjusted to living in the house during quarantine. Use your own photographs and sketches to illustrate.


Case for Adaptive Reuse: Tell us your conclusions about the adaptability of this dwelling.
Your writing needs to be analytical and critical – so you can best represent the conditions in the house, and its adaptability. We expect that you would write in the third-person in presenting your case to the university, but, you can choose to write the essay in a creative way, as a first person narrative—as long as you address the above points.


Descriptive: To describe the house in an evocative way so we can visualise the space and the architecture.


Interpretive: To tell us how you want us to understand this house – often using adjectives that convey qualitative features or help us understand its potential.


Critical: To guide us in understanding the pros and cons – advantages and disadvantages.
Analytical: To present your observations in ways that will help us form opinions on the house.
