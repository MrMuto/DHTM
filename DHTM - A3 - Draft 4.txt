The Suburb of Fitzroy
Fitzroy, Melbourne's first suburb, has undergone significant transformations since its inception. Originally belonging to the Wurundjeri people, the area saw a decline in its Indigenous population due to colonial expansion and urban development. Fitzroy's urban planning deviated from the Hoddle Grid model, favouring a blend of private and municipal interests that led to a mix of wealthy and working-class residents. Over time, economic depressions and government policies like the Slum Reclamation Act of 1938 led to the area becoming a hub for disadvantaged groups. Post-World War II, European immigrants reshaped the suburb's commercial life, adding bars, cafes, and clubs. The 1950s brought state-led slum clearance, forcibly displacing the communities. Today, Fitzroy is culturally diverse but also grapples with the challenges of gentrification, including the redevelopment of public housing for private interests.

The Neighbourhood
Indigenous History:
Fitzroy's land originally belonged to the Wurundjeri people. The area's Indigenous history is obscured by gentrification, though Tootell highlights a reactivation of Indigenous culture through diverse urban designs and public artworks, working in consultation with the community to embed Indigeneity into public spaces as part of reconciliation.[3] The house at 53 George Street and surrounding areas stands on land that holds historical and spiritual significance for the Indigenous community.


In Kevin Lynch’s work[4] They establish the city's five elements. Relevant here are the elements:
1. Paths.
* Streets, walkways, transit lines, canals, railroads
2. Edges.
* Edges are the linear elements not used or considered as paths by the observer.
* Boundaries between two phases, linear breaks in continuity: shores, railroad cuts, edges of development, walls.
* May be barriers, more or less penetrable, which close one region off from another, or they may be seams - lines along which two regions are joined together


The residence conveniently sits amongst numerous paths that converge into junctions where transportation nodes emerge for buses and trams. This includes cycling paths. Furthermore, the house benefits from being situated on an Edge boundary between a commercial district, industrial and educational district - functional for student accommodation or small organisation to operate. 


Current Demographic:
Today, Fitzroy sees an influx of young professionals and students, significantly impacting the local culture and economy. This demographic shift has implications for the house, making it a potentially attractive option for student accommodation.


Fear and Safety:
While Fitzroy is generally considered safe, like any urban area, it has its concerns. Proximity to well-lit main roads and public transport can alleviate safety fears, especially for students returning home late. The house's location offers such advantages, adding to its appeal as a potential student residence.

The Residence: 53 George Street
Historical Significance
The terrace at 53 George Street was constructed prior to 1858, possibly designed by John Gill. If attributed to Gill, it becomes an important architectural relic, conforming to the requirements of the 1849 Melbourne Building Act. This historical context adds a layer of significance to the house.
Architectural Modifications and Specialist Disability Accommodation
The house has undergone several changes to adapt to modern living requirements and meet the Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA) Design Standard for contemporary housing practice.[7] 




NDIS Specialist Disability Accommodation Design Standards Compliance
The refurbishment of 53 George Street aligns closely with the NDIS Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA) Design Standards, aimed at enhancing self-determination and social and economic participation. The residence has undergone significant modifications to meet these standards, particularly in the categories of "Improved Liveability" and "Robust Design," which are most relevant for its student tenants.


Access and Accessibility
The front gate and door have been widened, and ramps installed, ensuring a step-free, wheelchair-accessible connection from the site boundary to the entry. The ground floor has been opened up by removing partition walls, creating a more spacious living area that can accommodate three tenants.


Amenities and Features
Basic home amenities, as outlined in Clause 1.1 of the SDA, have been met. The laundry has been relocated outside but remains accessible, fulfilling the requirements of Clause 9.1. The garage has been converted into a multi-purpose space, which could serve as a small business venue, aligning with Clause 3 on car parking.


Safety and Robust Design
Smoke alarms have been installed in bedrooms and living spaces, adhering to Clause 24 on fire-safe design. The residence also features resilient materials and sound insulation in bedrooms, meeting the "Robust Design" criteria.


Future Improvements
While the residence meets the minimum requirements for "Improved Liveability" and "Robust Design," further modifications would be needed to meet the "Fully Accessible" and "High Physical Support" categories.

Proximity to Amenities
The house's location offers easy access to public transport and is within walking distance to parks like Fitzroy Gardens and Carlton Gardens. This proximity to amenities makes it a convenient option for students.
Experience of Sharing the House
Living in the house offers both advantages and disadvantages. Its layout and proximity to amenities make it convenient for student living. However, the house's historical elements may pose limitations on drastic modifications, which need to be considered if it is to be repurposed for student accommodation.

Social Networks: The African Diasporic Community
Fitzroy has a rich history of being home to various immigrant communities. In the years following 1945, the area experienced an ingress of European migrants, which significantly altered its commercial and social landscape. By the 1950s, Fitzroy also became a significant hub for the Aboriginal community, boasting a population of over 300 individuals and becoming the largest such community in Victoria.


Current Demographics:
Today, Fitzroy remains a diverse locale, home to a growing African diasporic community. This diversity offers students a unique opportunity for cultural exposure and broadening their social circles.


Redeveloping 53 George Street for an Immigrant Business
The garage at the home holds potential for conversion into a small immigrant-operated business, such as a beauty salon. This would necessitate various modifications, including weatherproofing the garage, ensuring disability access, and installing essential utilities. The establishment of such a business could serve as a focal point for community interaction, thereby enhancing the area's social dynamics.[9]


By integrating a small immigrant business into its structure, 53 George Street diversifies its utility and enriches its social and cultural contributions to the Fitzroy community. This aligns well with the area's history as a hub of various communities and adds a new dimension to its contemporary identity.


Health and Quarantine: Adapting to New Norms
Our relationship with domestic spaces is affected by quarantine, blurring the lines between work, leisure, and rest. The lockdown measures necessitate a reevaluation of daily routines and the use of space within the residence.


Impact on Daily Routines:
The pandemic necessitated a reevaluation of daily and weekly routines. While parks like Fitzroy Gardens and Carlton Gardens remain accessible for exercise, the pandemic has blurred the traditional boundaries between work, leisure, and rest within the home. [10]


Amenities and Activities:
Most amenities are still within reach, but the operation of small businesses, especially the proposed immigrant-run beauty salon, would be subject to government regulations. 
Spatial Adjustments:
The pandemic has highlighted the need for spaces that can adapt to various functions. The backyard could serve as an additional area for activities that require more space or ventilation.


Interior Modifications:
It's crucial to ensure that the interior spaces have adequate ventilation and natural lighting, incorporating elements of biophilic design where possible. Each household member should have enough space for both interaction and privacy, and the ability to quarantine in their rooms if necessary.


Adaptive Reuse: A Case for Flexibility and Sustainability
The residence has the potential to serve multiple functions, from student accommodation to a small immigrant-run business. The garage, for instance, could be repurposed into a beauty salon, requiring minimal changes like plumbing and heating installations.


The house's layout also allows for easy modifications to accommodate different needs. For example, the extra bathroom space upstairs could be used to free up more room for Bedroom 3. The various outdoor spaces, including the weather-proofed garage and the backyard, offer additional areas that can be utilised for different purposes.


Moreover, the house's design interventions, such as widened doors and removed partitions, not only make the space more accessible but also more adaptable. These changes align with the broader trend of adaptive reuse, which emphasises flexibility and sustainability in architecture.


Conclusion
The residence at 53 George Street in Fitzroy presents a compelling case for adaptive reuse, serving as both student accommodation and a small business venue. Its rich historical background, architectural significance, and recent design interventions align with the diverse needs of its potential occupants. The house's layout and modifications offer flexibility, from accommodating a small immigrant business to ensuring pandemic preparedness.


The property's proximity to parks and public transport options adds to its appeal, while its adaptability ensures that it can meet changing public health guidelines. The residence also aligns with broader community goals, including inclusivity and economic viability, making it a sustainable choice for repurposing.


In light of these factors, 53 George Street holds significant potential for adaptive reuse. Its versatility and thoughtful design make it an ideal candidate for meeting the evolving needs of students and small business owners alike, particularly within the context of a post-pandemic world.
