SPEAKER 1
My name is Alex Felson. I'm Elizabeth Murdoch share of landscape architecture at the University of Melbourne. I'm talking today about the history of zoos, uh, to introduce some of the problematic challenges that is create for design and to think about ways forward to inform ecological design strategies. So I'm going to share my screen and begin. So I called this studying the history of use to inform contemporary ecological design and constructed ecology. In a sense, this this presentation goes through and kind of unpacks or looks at the history of use and identify as a set of issues that you face. Uh, there's the I do present on or I do have presentations and lectures on ecological design, constructed ecology and also teach classes at the union on these subjects. So you are welcome to explore these further. If you're interested in this topic, I also want to respectfully acknowledge and seek fair treatment for the traditional owners of the land, the boomerang and run everywhere on people's as a combination and pay respects to their elders past, present and future.

SPEAKER 0
Okay, so really, the history of Jews and many of

SPEAKER 1
you have probably been to zoos and already know that they have some embedded problematic issues. Historically, that is also quite true. And today's look is really kind of exploring some of those historical conditions and thinking about what zoos and body and one some of the challenges that they face in their design. Uh, there have been adaptations and changes and updates to zoo designs enclosures, which are the individual spaces that animals are positioned in over time. I think it starts for me anyway, with thinking about what is nature and starting to understand where we are today in an evolutionary time frame, how we as humans modified land and started to, uh, Harv out spaces from natural systems and to construct and create environments that it became our built environment and then on the right. How we are now starting to think about reconstructing a rebuilding, uh, natural systems or things that look like nature and that function in certain ways to effectively to provide us with a sense of, um, of history and a sense of identity. And the thing about zoos is recognising that the zoos themselves are really a manufactured nature, as much about theatre, um in performance as they are about anything else. And ultimately their ecological function is kind of is problematic and at issue, I think, even today. So when you think about this progression of of going from kind of evolutionary history to modification of land to constructed ecosystems, it's important to start to understand the field of urban ecology, a growing field of development. And this is just looking historically at a particular individual. Patrick Getty's who is an urban designer and who developed an overlooked our kind of looking down on this in this case Edinburgh and starting to think about the relationship across the land, um, and thinking about activities across the land and relating humans to geographic space. And he actually designed, for example, Tel Aviv, which is was designed essentially as a garden city with a series of landscape, just components of the city. So you can start to see how investigating urban ecology started to lead to kind of thinking about design, attitude and design solutions. And in a way, today's lecture is partly to make connections between understanding the the ways, the problems or the challenges of the issues and how they get translated into design thinking. And we know with urban ecology that there's a whole range of factors that are influencing the urban environment that didn't exist in the same way in the past. So we've introduced a whole set of issues. Also, there's processes like the hydrologic cycle and other processes that are taking place in an urban context just modified. And so this urban ecology is actually very rich area of investigation with an interesting history, for example, here that adapted from superb in 1973 looking at the gradient across the city from forests through kind of industrial zones, railways into the inner city in the way that impacts climate, soils, relief, vegetation, empathetic vegetation, fauna, etcetera, and in a sense, the zoo is decoupled from this urban ecology. It's bringing wildlife that would not normally exist in that context into a very urban setting and introducing them in this way to that to that context. Just to say that, you know, I don't go into some detail, though I do teach on urban ecology. But there are gaps. There's knowledge gaps in urban ecology between the science and the design. And so when you start thinking about how to incorporate ecological science into design and planning, there are challenges to across these two because they're quite distinct areas or fields of development. Um, zoos are interesting because they embody some of that thinking some scientific information, ecological thinking, Um, but they also are very much about design in portraying and theatre and exhibition. I'm contrasting views in some ways with ecological design as an approach that embodies or takes into account urban ecological systems because it's very distinct from what zoos are. And I think there is an opportunity to redeveloper improve on or to transform zoos into spaces that could embody more of these ecological functions rather than focusing on display. I don't get into detail on this, so I'm just introducing these ideas to you. And then I'm going into more detail and Jews themselves and unpacking some of the underlying challenges. You yourselves can start to think about how this lecture relates back to ecological design as an area of focus, but just to say within ecological design, when when designers are looking to construct ecosystems that have functionality, they often follow a build it. They will come model so they create the functional habitats and assume that wildlife will arrive and landscape architecture are involved in this kind of design. They are also involved in more formal design strategies, where ecological function may not be as important, but social, ecological function or human interactions with those faces are. There's also a performance metrics that are growing and developing around assessing performance and monitoring sort of sustainability approaches. These are important as well. Uh, they often don't influence as much the thinking about the aesthetic and design aspects, but they're they're important as drivers of action. There is also collaborative models where different researchers and designers start are starting to work together and looking at ways in which they can incorporate their knowledge effectively in ecological design. Uh, there's restoration projects looking at and thinking about what type of aesthetics or how do we design or restore or regenerate landscapes effectively. And in many cases, those take on a naturalistic aesthetic, um, sort of building on nature as a as a driver, although in contemporary work in the contemporary world, this may not also always work as well, because when you have to construct a system making it naturalistic takes time and effort and keeping it that way, you can also be challenging. There's a bio mimicry, which is really thinking about mimicking the functionality of certain aspects of the natural systems and translating those under an urban fabric urban context. Uh, and there's things like biofuels recognising the innate urge to seek out connections with nature and other forms of life, and understanding the positive impacts and starting to incorporate by affiliate designed into the design of your projects. So ecological design ecological design is an area of focus is growing and developing, and in some ways I would say distinct from zoo design and zoo development. The main reasons, or some of the reasons it's distinct, is that it looks at economic or ecological function and seeks to construct landscapes that have, uh, biological value and that contributes to, uh, to the performance of the urban ecology of the system. Zoos in many ways are quite distinct from that because they are essentially a space where animals or nature or brought in and put on display to two people and the the kind of, uh, in a way, it's a de contextualising of the organism and the organism itself represents. It was representative of nature, Uh, but when it's brought into the context of a cage or enclosure, uh, in an urban context and put on display, it loses a lot of its functionality. It loses its context. It loses its relationship to the land. It loses its relationship to other organisms. Uh, so it has this distinct quality of that that breaks down a lot of the ecological function of the kind of the natural item, you'd say. So I think it's important to recognise the kind of debates and and challenges of zoos in relation to our contemporary world and thinking about greening and thinking about urban ecology and urban design, and I'm going to mention this throughout. But really now focus on zoo history and get into more detail. So the zoo design into history really started as a trading of exotic wildlife. So it was this kind of, uh, interest in these exotic creatures as colonisation was taking place and as people were travelling around the world and typically wealthier individuals were seeking. Or we're looking for these kinds of opportunities to get these animals for themselves and to start learning or start, start to play, place these animals in the context of their own spaces. So here's oversize menagerie, which was an early term for these spaces where animals were kept. And throughout the lecture I'm going to talk a little bit about design thinking. But here you can see that the the inner courtyard around the middle here was a space that was dominated by a building, and it distributed people, um, into the different enclosure spaces so that you could essentially have kind of an urban or a cultural experience where you had the opportunity to walk through these and through these areas and start to understand and interact with the wildlife that was brought in engaged in these spaces. And it's an interesting symmetry and organisation of the built environment very much dominated by the form of the building with the animals in it. Um and you can see that each of the enclosures is fairly similar or is driven by kind of practical concerns around how you create this octagon shape. So there was not much going for recognising the distinct animal conditions. There is a water feature here, for example, that was catering to specific species. Uh, but otherwise there's very little differences between the enclosures.

SPEAKER 0
Um, so but But when you start looking at the

SPEAKER 1
example of other examples of zoos, for example, the garden and the plants with the menagerie, uh in in Paris is a museum of natural history, which was established in 17 93. It's very interesting to see the difference between the botanical garden, which is the geometric forms that you can see. And also you can see those in the photograph on the right and the organic form of the menagerie or the zoo. In this case, it really shows you the way. Designers are thinking differently about animals and the organisation of space around animals and the way they were thinking about plants So the plants were organised in these planting beds, partly driven by kitchen gardens. And, um, you know, the way that agriculture was organised and the the notion of even research and experimentation and on the animals were organised in an organic way to kind of suggest ideas of nature and to kind of bring in organic form as part of the design. I think it's really important to mention as Zeus started growing, that there was also a dark period in the human zoo concept, and this was, uh, partly driven by people like Carl Hagenbeck, who was a very influential animal collector. He also would bring people and put people on display, uh, including indigenous people displayed in villages built and built in zoos specifically for show. And I think this is it's important to recognise that there is a rather jaded history in terms of the idea of putting things on display. And I think this also relates back to the tarantulas, uh, term, a term used just describe aboriginal people originally by colonisers, which is hugely problematic. And, uh, you know, I don't go into this in detail in this lecture, but it's important to recognise the inherent problems and issues associated with the idea of putting people on display in in this kind of context, Uh, and and to also think about how that, um, you know how that kind of mindset might have influenced or impacted relationships and the development of historically of treatment? Uh, seriously problematic treatment of aboriginal people, uh, and other indigenous indigenous cultures. Another thing that zoos early Jews developed with these kind of cultural appropriations and sort of historicism ation of architecture in relation to animals. So starting to position animals in spaces that with with architecture that reflected their their origins. And it is interesting to think about this from an architectural standpoint where the kind of, um, forms, for example, the kind of almost, uh, you know, uh, these shapes spaces started to also function for zoo enclosures. So the architecture itself was taken from these sort of formal designs, or your here is kind of Islamic architecture that was then organised around cage space, and also the heights were quite distinct. So there's examples of kind of architectural thinking that were translated into the form of the building themselves. This is the first reptile house in London. And one of the things that's quite interesting about this example is the way that the windows moved from the side up to the roof and part of the driver. Here was the need for reptiles for sunlight, uh, two and two to start to react and respond to, uh, the seasonality and they night and patterns for their own health. And so, you know, this idea that they were taking architectural organisation and traditional practises and rethinking them for the species that they were they were inhabiting. This space, I think, is interesting from from an architectural design or design perspective, because it starts to show you kind of an early version of thinking through options for trying to capture manage architectural design in relation to the form and shape of particular, uh, animals. And that notion of responding the design responding to the species in some ways, I think is an interesting has interesting potential contributions to thinking about ecological design. This is a drafthouse from 18 20. Uh, this is one of the first major zoos zoo designs, um, one of the first major buildings, and you can see the height of the windows in a way that they're organised specifically for the tall giraffe. And this is the lion houses in the Berlin Zoo around the 19 thirties. And it's the kind of sort of very formal relationship with the the the deconstruction of pieces here, where there's a cage and there's a zone here that's the sunlight zone with plants that are sort of very abstracted, kind of, um, uh, sort of very abstracted senses of nature and then the benches here where that gives you this orientation, This really starts to show you the way in which Jews design focused on the pedestrian or the user and and the orientation of the user to the cage. Um, there was, you know, with the design there was a lot of exploration of sort of naturalistic applications and sort of caged nature, but also treating nature as a kind of scenery, you know, or as a place to be seen. So dressing up and going to the zoo and having these relationships with, uh, sort of wild nature that's controlled. Um, and you know, So this notion of kind of going back to this earlier mention of what is nature this zoo's became kind of a complicated a space where, you know, there were sort of indications of naturalistic features, and they were also the animals themselves so that were taken out of nature and brought into these highly constructed environments. And then people flowed through this and had their own perception of those spaces and their own theatrical experiences of the environment. So one of the big things I'm going to go through and talk through now the series of kind of examples of with zoos of some of the challenges one of those is really the boundary. So that boundary that I talked about her here, um, this kind of boundary between the animal and the people, um, is an ongoing aspect and kind of consideration with zoos. It's a very important driver of how zoos are organised. Um, and early on in landscape architecture, there were there were projects, or there was an approach that was used in the English landscape called the ha ha wall, which is essentially a You don't see it from afar, but as you get closer, it's essentially a ditch that controls the wildlife's movement into space. So you have kind of a protective zone that can't be crossed, but it becomes invisible and folded into the landscape. And this notion of the Ha Ha wa was a very early example of humans starting to manage those their relationship to nature. So the boundaries are quite important. I think they are. It's got a little bit further, but the boundary also has is related to this issue of escape. Here's a mountain goats, It's jumping over the fence and escape is another piece related to boundary that that is problematic and part of the zoo enclosure design is dealing with the issue of escape and enclosure and control. Um, and you know, examples of these relationships about boundary also is, you know, has to do with protection and safety, um, with the animal. But there are ways in which these have been blurred over time with different types of circus environments, etcetera. And you know it's interesting when you start looking at those boundaries. The moat dimensions, which were originally developed by hanging back and others actually are sized to respond to the capacity of the animals to jump or to, um, get across. And so there, there you can see that there's a kind of design intention behind the those early mode construction and the slopes that were used to address particular species, you know, and to manage species over time. And you can see here that there is also this relationship in boundaries of orientation and the level at which people are looking at the the animals. In this case in the Bronx, the seal exhibit at the Bronx Zoo kind of looking into and down into this large water body that that is the enclosure. And so there's the, you know, the mod and the edge, and the boundary becomes a very important feature of zoos and a driver of design considerations in zoos, and that when you're just relating this back to ecological design, boundaries are quite important because biological, our species are often there are only certain species that are comfortable being in an urban context and around people. And so we're always sort of struggling as designers, as ecological designers to think about how to partition space is effectively and how to define boundaries between human activity and biological activity, for example, and you know, you might think about seasonal reproduction or seasonal visitation patterns of particular species or, for example, nesting of turtles, et cetera, in. In order to manage the seasonal reproductive practises, we often have to construct boundaries to control human access public access to allow those species to reproduce. So that's kind of a contemporary example of this. This is the another illustration of the Berlin Zoo that looks at the kind of naturalistic design and the one of one of the the the ideas there is really thinking about community. Um, so another issue is the idea of managing or having, um, establishing community, um, ecology community dynamic. So this is typically in in the non urban system or ecological system. Even in urban areas, species are interacting, and so the species interacting are a fundamental part of the ecology of a system in zoos. Interestingly, uh, in this enclosure or set of enclosures, there was an attempt to create a reconstruct, a kind of African step in this enclosure. It all has to do with the vantage point of the view point and looking across individual enclosures that collapse into a a sense of understanding of the entire of the community ecology of this of this system. But you can see that each enclosure is actually distinct and separate as you move through. But when you view it, you see them, the animals together. So this really, I think, is one of the best illustrations of the role of theatre in zoo design, recognising that these species aren't actually interacting. And so there isn't really that kind of biological or ecological value of community dynamics, um, species interactions, uh, and that the construction of the context and the placement of animals in enclosures really for display is is kind of important issue and challenge with new design. Uh, and these Jews were, you know, they were. They were very much intended to kind of create these these panoramic views and to illustrate the the animals in their in their kind of natural environment. But what you really don't have is any kind of predator prey relationship where you have, um, species relying on or taking advantage of other species for food. Uh, in that cycle of food, web and trophic structures where you actually get species interactions taking place. A building on this, uh and, um, this kind of comes hand in hand is the issue of territory and territory for the animals in zoos are one of the biggest you know, issues when you take an animal that would otherwise live in a very large area or Rome or move seasonally or relocate periodically and put them into a small enclosure, they lose that relationship to the land and they lose the, um they end up living in a highly stressed environment and stressed condition. And so so it's impossible, really, in many cases to establish a space large enough to accommodate many of the species that are in zoos. So territory, um, and space becomes really a major issue. And, um, you know, you can think about some very beautiful architectural designs like the menagerie, um, in the Bronx Zoo, you know, in the way that the stairway kind of moves along it. So there's there's this kind of very elegant organisation of circulation around this large building. Um, but the species that are in here really have very limited, really limited territorial zone, very completely unlike their more natural environment. And so they're highly constrained in these environments, and, um, you know, they really very much on display for people. Um, so you know, when you think about something like a mountain line, for example, Um, and look at the kind of conditions that they have. This is in California showing in different colours 12 different mountain lion territories. You can see even in this context, where they've been highly modified already because of urbanisation, the zones in which they occupy our extensive, um on the right is sort of is a song sparrows mapping, showing the way that the species are distributed across properties. So this, I think, is interesting also to show that the territories of these songbirds actually do sort of fit within, um, and across these these kind of property ownership and so not every species is the same. Some species do have a rather small territory that they might occupy that can fit with or fit into suburban development. Um, but this idea of how to manage and how to accommodate territory in urban ecology is a really important consideration. With zoos. It's essentially impossible. So there's really no reconstructing this, you know, effectively. And there's examples in dioramas or interior spaces where you might visit in the Natural History Museum, where they start to suggest to represent the extensive areas that the animals might visit or or might live in but in in the zoo enclosures. You know, the these species are often pretty densely populated, and, um and so the population densities can be can be rather high, and the space is very limited. And here you can see just to top this off this kind of example of where they're constructing a a space where there's a mode that separates the polar bears from the, uh, seals from the polar bears, which you can't really see. But essentially, they were actually putting predator and prey near each other, but so it's kind of within the vicinity, but not not in any kind of predator prey relationship. Uh, here, here are the polar bears here. Um, so this kind of there was also an attempt in zoos to construct this kind of rock ary or to build these spaces that were both, uh, pretty indestructible. So they were. They were made partly because the animals that occupy these faces all day end up denuding the environment are breaking down the environment. So it's actually very hard to maintain the environment that the animals are in. And so the early practises were to use this kind of rock quarry, and you can see when you look at the inside underneath these kind of constructed nature of these, uh, built space is actually quite interesting. Um, And here you can see the big mode and, um, and people, um, looking at this, this is the map in terraces that are really quite interesting when you look at the way that they are constructed. So in this case is there is there is a lot of interesting functionality to these building systems. Um, there were, uh, seawater aquariums. There were large reservoirs that we're managing the flow of water, you know, through the space and all the kind of back of house components of the system were buried behind these enclosure spaces. Um, so they use these these spaces to kind of construct the, um, maintenance and ecological components or or hydrological components of their designs is the movement terraces in London Zoo. So these architectural features in zoos can get quite interesting in terms of the relationship they have to managing populations. This is the gorilla habitat and jungle jungle gym in Apple store in Holland, which is actually one of the few zoos that allows um smaller monkeys, uh, to Rome or to move around in space is that people can also move. So there's actually kind of an interactive, um, spaces in this zoo for people with animals. But you can see that one of the things that that was a development with Jews really in the seventies was an approach called behavioural enhancement, where they started looking more to construct spaces that the animal, the animals, were, um, made them more active and more, um, interactive. And we're, you know, got them to kind of behaviour act in ways that they would normally do in the more natural setting. So there is this idea around constructing spaces for the animals. Behavioural activities was a kind of wave of interest that has has influences, I think, a very positive ways because, you know, it was coming from this tradition of putting the animals on display, putting them in these kind of, um, constructed spaces that were very harsh and that we're also, uh, organised with very little, very limited spaces for hiding or for, um, you know, for respite. So they were always on display for people, and it was extremely unhealthy for the animals and also got a lot of complaints. But I think this is one of the very interesting sort of enclosure designs that has kind of architectural futures. This was designed by virtual the kind of tectonic architects in 1934. It's the penguin pool in London. Soon I realised this is very, um, London centric, uh, this talk. But I've started to visit some of the disease in Australia, Incorporate those into my presentation, But you can see in this design the kind of careful, um, construction and, uh, sort of rebar construction and preparation to pour. So basically, what they did is they constructed these, um, these slides and they actually would the penguins would slide down these, um, these slides and they would They even had a system of introducing food into the water. They would slide down to do so. It's a very, um, interesting interplay between the architecture and the penguin behavioural tendencies. Um, and here is a one of this early design of the gorilla house by the same architects where they designed kind of a climate controlled conditions. So movable partitioning wall, um, and, uh, windows for sunlight. And this kind of climate controlled environment started becoming more popular for certain species. UM, that allowed for various activities and allowed for spaces that the guerrillas could occupy that with different conditions depending on the temperature and the environment. So it's starting to cater to the species a bit more and recognise the importance of quality of spaces in the construction. Uh, this is the world of darkness, um, in the Bronx Zoo and hear what they did is it was a steel frame structure. The day and night were shifted, so basically they they made at night within the building that so that when you walk in, it's quite dark. But you, the bats that are in the darkness are very active, so they kind of flipped the They flipped the night and day timeframe to essentially put the bats on display for people during while while the zoo is open. I think this idea of manipulating or modifying the behavioural pattern of the organism to, you know, as a theatrical performance, I think it's quite interesting from a design perspective. And, uh, yeah, and then here's the Elephant House in where they started to kind of adapt these sort of spaces for elephant closures and started to bring that into the kind of design aesthetic of the of the project. And I mentioned this behavioural enhancement strategy. The there was this wave of interest in trying to reconstruct or redevelop behavioural patterns. Um, there was also pushed back, so there was a bit of conflict in this stage, and here's the Antwerp Zoo in 1968 or the polar bears diving in for fish, which is gets randomly dropped in during the day into a tube that send it sends them swimming in the pool. So this is an early example of an attempt to start to create behavioural patterns in the animal. Here's a goat hill in the San Diego Zoo from the 19 fifties that gave the goats opportunities to climb. Um, here's the lion, then just going back to this traditional historical time, when when you when the animal is very much on display and had very little opportunity in this context, to do things or to break out of it. This is from San Diego, so another serious issue with zoo management is disease, and this is something that often is hidden from the public. But you know, because you have, uh, animals caged up in and occupying these spaces. There's a constant threat of disease which could spread, and, um, and the animals themselves aren't aren't really all that healthy, and there's very few of them. And so the medical, the role of health and maintenance of the animals over time requires, um, the zoo zoo managers to be engaged with the animals. And so they're actually has to be some control. They can't be completely wild because there has to be some maintenance of their health because of the issues of disease. And so one of the things that's interesting, for example, with the recent design of zoos and the immersion exhibits that we enjoy more, which I get into in a little bit more detail is that typically the animals are put into the emerging as if it's during the day and then brought into cages at night in spaces where they can be managed for to deal with disease issues and to just maintain their health. And this idea of, um, um this this this idea of, uh, of, uh, the health management, um, you know, relates in some ways to the territory issues that I mentioned earlier, and the whole question of how to, you know, develop the scale needed to support animals in this highly constrained context is always debated. And, you know, there's kind of a lot of artifice embedded into design and do enclosures down to, you know, this is a kind of natural history example. But the notion of reconstructing um, kind of components of the organism artificially is kind of a fundamental aspect of zoo design and zoom management. And so working to kind of recognising that territory changes are pretty intense and and that time frames are limited lead to these rather robust and high budget efforts to kind of reconstruct and build things in ways that require that facilitate the kind of biological communities, um, or the biological conditions that support, uh, at least cater to some aspects of the organisms needs, um, with There's always an issue of crowding and, um, and so there's this kind of management of population size, which is in some ways unprecedented, since the organisms themselves have never lived in this context before. So the idea of what kind of population densities are appropriate are driven mostly by experiences with, you know, with with zoos and and hands hands on experience. Um, so reproduction is another major issue, and basically, it's quite difficult to get organisms to reproduce zoo environments because they're living in high stress conditions. They have very limited a very limited number of partners. Uh, they're not. They're not in there in there in the context that they have evolutionarily evolved to live in. And, um, so reproduction with zoo animals is always a challenge. And that's part of why um, you know the idea of zoos as a space that holds the genetic diversity of wildlife in the world, which is something that I think is becoming increasingly recognised as a potential so or as an important value. This notion of disease are holding onto species that that may be extinct in the wild is really important consideration and maybe should influence in some ways how much investment and how we organise and build these zoo enclosures. Because, you know, in the future, uh, they may become increasingly important. And there are we already know that the, um that there's serious challenges with trying to manage for reproduction. Um, I mentioned earlier the issue of disease that relates to this zookeeper routine, which is essentially the need to maintain essentially a relationship with the organism over time, Um, in a routine that allows the zookeeper to manage that organism and that that zookeeper routine Really In some ways, um, pools, the kind of originally wild animals or many of these are born in captivity as well into a, um, domesticated condition to some gradient of domestic um, living. And, uh, so there's the issue of feeding, which historically often would become sort of a part of the theatre of the zoo. Um, there's increasing interest in kind of not doing as much of this, although it happens with certain species. But there's a lot of a lot more going on around, um, creating behavioural enhancements that allow the organism to feed in ways they would maybe normally feed in the wild. Uh, but But you can imagine that this kind of feeding condition can create complicated, um, situations where you have other other animals kind of taking advantage. Um, there's also public opinion, which has had a pretty big influence on zoo design, you know, so people seeing spaces like this one and complaining about the low quality and the stress nature of the organisms. And a lot of people have mixed feelings about Jews and that public opinion has driven many cases the design and development of zoos, especially since the seventies and eighties, with, uh with immersion exhibits which have been more recent, you know. So this idea of, um, starting to recognise the challenges and the complexity that this relationship between people and, um wild animals create is becoming more of an issue over time. Um, this is an example of the behavioural enhancement that hell, Markowitz, who was one of the leaders of this developed in Portland, Oregon, essentially a fine meatball that was dangled and bounced around and got the the animal to jump and flail for it. Uh, and so you know, the the interesting thing is the way in which the Jews have evolved since they were originally built into these kind of extensive spaces. And here's an example of the Melbourne Zoo that, you know, had a very formal beginning but has started to really transform. Um, you know, into this kind of, uh, organic space set of space is embedded within a formal structure. Um, and So the zoo exhibit you know, the zoo design and exhibits. I think it's quite interesting in the way that they, the enclosures in circulation, start to interact and relate. You know, I'm going to detail on this, but, um, there's there's there's interesting ways of there's interesting urban design components or there's ways I think, which is could be developed further around how circulation is designed and how the public moves through those faces. It's already starting to develop. This is another one of how Markowitz is behavioural enhancements, which were rather controversial. But where the tiger controls this, uh, council, this is in the panel. Wanna Sumatran Swamp exhibit in Hilo, Hawaii. You can basically give it. It selects options for food and by pushing a certain panel, can have food brought in mhm. Um, so it's just taking a minute. The so you know there's there's this conflict between There's this public pressure that started to grow around, how we manage our organisms, uh, in zoos and how we deal with those. And there's there's interesting sort of conflicts that are mostly avoided, but that occasionally occur between people and, um, and wildlife that often lead to changes in our the way we manage. Um, and there's, you know, there's there's examples of of kind of trying to construct conditions that cater to the species functionality. And there's been this kind of evolution of zoos into pretty interesting, um, developments, especially with the immersion exhibits that started really with Jones and Jones in Seattle, Washington, um, where there was an effort to start to construct spaces that were naturalised and that, um, situated the viewer not always in the primary role, the primary position, but as someone who flows through spaces that are constructed in ways that give the, um, the animals space, the variety of spaces and areas of respite. And I think these immersion exhibits really are starting to introduce a whole new kind of style of design thinking in the zoo. Um, a lot of the issues that I've mentioned already remain as issues, but there are opportunities, I think, with the immersion exhibits to rethink the orientation in the relationship of people to the organism. Um, as you can see in this cross section where you have different levels where you start to see down to the, uh, animal, this is in the woodland proxy again, Um, in the Congo exhibit, where you start to have these, um, sprayers, you know, that create distinct micro climate conditions, which I think is interesting from an urban ecology perspective, Um, and this notion of orientation and having an opportunity to see each other so that there's kind of these relationships of visual relationships that give the animals kind of distinct qualities of experience. So this idea of how close you can be and how you can orient the user to understand the organisms in their enclosures is something that's been evolving. The lion exhibit on the right shows you the kind of way in which rock are used to give hiding spaces for certain species that they don't want to be as much on display. And then you can start to see how these misters and these kind of constructed environments, um give spaces for, uh, the lines to get into, you know, a variety of conditions and interestingly, the when you start looking at the construction, there are some really careful, carefully thought out ways of building into the exhibit lighting and, um, and kind of partitioning. Here's this log here that you see on one side and on the other, it actually serves in forms of fence. It's just not visible from that view. The red panda exhibit. And you know, so this kind of different types of vetting that control access, but allow visibility. Um, you know, and these kinds of theatrical approaches to design are highly constructed and crafted, as you can see here, uh, but they create this theatrical environment that we get to see the animals and in a more natural setting. Um, most of these spaces, um, well, they look like they've, you know, they look fairly natural. Take a lot of work, even careful crafting of root structure here by Grant Jones and others. Uh, and they are important in terms of the, um, illustrating the kind of investment in the space is typically with emerging exhibits. The vegetation does get denuded over time and the, uh so the vegetation gets replenished, typically daily. So that idea of understanding the kind of behind the scenes work that's needed for managing vegetation, um and for managing the enclosures for the species is important to understand. These aren't self sufficient environments. There's issues of soil compaction and erosion that impact the enclosures and that create serious challenges for managing the space. Uh, And then there's There's the behind the scenes cages that actually are still part of the zoo system for managing disease and for dealing with the population distribution, et cetera. And so I'll wrap up by just sort of emphasising the variety of factors that are challenges or that create issues for zoos as spaces, especially when you start thinking of them in relation to kind of an urban ecology and ecological function. Uh, in some ways these kind of challenges, like territory and boundaries, public pressure, issues of reproduction and scale, the kind of vegetation, soil compaction and erosion issues of disease and crowding, um, predator prey feeding, etcetera. These are actually issues that we face as designers when thinking about developing ecological design projects. So it's helpful to understand zoos as one kind of strange and unique entity of design. And how zoos, um, some of the challenges associated with them and how these are also also challenges for thinking about greening cities and constructing urban ecosystems that can effectively support those species. Um, and it does fall into this question of understanding what is nature, you know? And how are we defining ourselves in relation to nature? Um, and you know what? How do we embed or how are we dealing over time, especially as humans modify biological systems and modify the world through climate change? What are we doing in terms of our design strategies to accommodate these changes? And how are we? How can we recognise our relationship with nature? Um and kind of carefully articulate our interpretation of nature in ways that are effectively allow cross over. And I mentioned earlier this kind of gap between the ecological sciences and design professions. So, you know, moving forward the just in summary kind of thinking about bridging between ecology and landscape architecture and translating across these gaps to identified kind of shared medium spaces. I developed this diagram to sort of emphasise that to think about the collateral terms that we might use like wilderness, um, and the design terms like the garden and how these shared terms like biodiversity, might fit between those kind of conditions and help us to start to understand, to understand ways in which we can work with kind of contemporary thinking and contemporary terms, terms to bridge across the ecological sciences and design professions effectively to start to approach ecological design and design and planning. Um, as in in a strategic ways, understanding these gaps and understanding the complex challenges that we've just gone over in in application, particularly with zoos. So I'm going to wrap up here, and I want to thank you and for listening, and I hope you enjoyed the presentation show.
